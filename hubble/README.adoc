=== Overview

Hubble is a frontend application which communicates with the Quasar API
in order to manage Starship networks.
It shows all available networks in a sidebar, in addition to a 'Create New' button.
When you select a network it shows network settings, which you can modify.
You also have the option to delete a network.

The network settings page also shows all nodes in the network as collapsible
cards, which initially show simple information such as the nodename,
hostname and IP address,
but can be expanded to reveal settings for the node that can be updated such
as firewall rules, and groups which the node is in etc.
